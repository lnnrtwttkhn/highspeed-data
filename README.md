# Highspeed Data

This repository combines all *raw* and *unprocessed* data that was acquired in the study "Faster than thought: Detecting sub-second activation sequences with sequential fMRI pattern analysis", Wittkuhn & Schuck, 2020, *Nature Communications*.

By *raw* and *unprocessed* data we mean data stored *as it was acquired originally* without any additional editing.

- Regarding **MRI data** these are the *raw* DICOM files returns by the MRI scanner after acquisition.
- Regarding **behavioral data** these are the *raw* behavioral files as produced by the `highspeed-task` when participants performed it either during training and practice outside the scanner or during the main phase inside the MRI scanner.

## Usage

To be announced. Please contact Lennart Wittkuhn in the meantime.
